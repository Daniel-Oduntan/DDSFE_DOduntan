The homework was basically about hypothesis testing and statistical analysis. The homeworks gave good insights on how to carefully test facts using statistics with python and draw out conclusions from the tests
I learnt how to carefully use statistics with python to test for facts and test wheather a hypothesis is null or not. 
I worked on this homework on my own
I made researches via youtube and khan academy on how to solve problems relating to this with python
